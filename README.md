4. Recursion from FEM-algos and day04 exercises
5. [Real world example](day05/README.md) of the importance of understanding algo problems
6. Review of big oh, recursion, binary search, bubblesort, mergesort, quicksort.
7. Linked Lists, Start the tic-tac-toe game
8. Exam 1
9. Results from exam, Cover graphs, and do the [space station project](space-station.md), build one of the graph theory games (detailed below under day 9), or start the [sudoku project](sudoku.md).
10. Project work
11. Project work
12. Final exam on data structures

# Day 1

We discuss ands and ors, truthy and falsy values and the peculiarity in JS when you use and or or with two truthy or falsy values. An and/or expression evaluates to the first value determining its result. Ie, the first truthy value in an or, the first falsy value in an and, or the last truthy value in an all-true and.  

We also discuss DeMorgan's laws and distribution, then we start on the day 1 worksheet. Finally we Cover time complexity of programs, starting it off with this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8syQKTdgdzc  

# Day 6
Big Oh review, recursion, binary search. We cover recursion and binary search using khan academy. For recursion exercises, we use factorial, exponentiation, and Fibonacci. During the second half of the class we solve skill-matched exercises.

# Day 7
Go over bubblesort, mergesort, Euclid's GCD, and quiz1.

# Day 8
Cover BST, Stacks, queues, and do the [space station project](space-station.md).

# Day 9

Khan academy graph representation, breadth first search, [Depth First Search]http://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/depth_first_traversal.htm, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlPuVe5Otio and Graph Theory Game.

Cover basics of graph theory and do a project, for instance the [connect 4 game](http://www.swolebrain.com/connect4), the [sim game](http://www.swolebrain.com/sim-game), or the [peg game](http://www.joenord.com/puzzles/peggame/).
