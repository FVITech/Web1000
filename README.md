#Summary
1. Big oh notation, boolean algebra, demorgan's laws. Explain everything needed for the worksheet and then have the students complete the [day 1 worksheet](day1.js)
2. Introduce the board game project. Sample code: https://github.com/Swolebrain/board-game
3. Finish board game
4. Intro to angularjs: puppy clicker, quote of the day, and quote of the day with custom directive.
5. More angularJS exercises (codecademy)
6. Review of big oh, recursion, binary search, bubblesort, mergesort.
7. Arrays in low level languages (contiguous memory of immutable size), arrays in JS, linked lists (interface and implementation). Define interfaces for stacks and queues. Go over bubblesort, mergesort, Euclid's GCD, and quiz1.
8. Cover BST, Stacks, queues, and do the [space station project](space-station.md).
9. Khan academy graph representation, breadth first search, [Depth First Search]http://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/depth_first_traversal.htm, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlPuVe5Otio and Graph Theory Game.
10. Sudoku Project
11. Sudoku Project (continued)
12. Final exam on angular and data structures

#Day 1

We discuss ands and ors, truthy and falsy values and the peculiarity in JS when you use and or or with two truthy or falsy values. An and/or expression evaluates to the first value determining its result. Ie, the first truthy value in an or, the first falsy value in an and, or the last truthy value in an all-true and.  

We also discuss DeMorgan's laws and distribution, then we start on the day 1 worksheet. Finally we Cover time complexity of programs, starting it off with this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8syQKTdgdzc  

#Day 6
Big Oh review, recursion, binary search. We cover recursion and binary search using khan academy. For recursion exercises, we use factorial, exponentiation, and Fibonacci. During the second half of the class we solve skill-matched exercises.

#Day 7
Go over bubblesort, mergesort, Euclid's GCD, and quiz1.

#Day 8
Cover BST, Stacks, queues, and do the [space station project](space-station.md).

#Day 9
Cover basics of graph theory and do a project, for instance the [connect 4 game](http://www.swolebrain.com/connect4) or the [sim game](http://www.swolebrain.com/sim-game).
