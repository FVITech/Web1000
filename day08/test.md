#Angular, Data Structures, and search algos exam

Instructions: create a new repository called ng-ds-test. Within this repo, create a README.md file. Copy and paste all of these questions into this README file and answer them.

1. Name and describe the two main operations of a stack (to add and remove data).


2. Name and describe the two main operations of a queue (to add and remove data).

3. Draw the tree resulting from adding the following sequence of numbers to an empty tree: 30, 45, 15, 10, 50, 40, 20, 27


4. Is this tree balanced? If not, which rotation needs to be done? (Use the following rotation as an example: rightRotation(30), or leftRotation(10))


5. Now add 29. Is the tree balanced? If not, which rotation needs to be done? (Use the following rotation as an example: rightRotation(30), or leftRotation(10))

6. Consider the following tree:    
*-    5  
   2     8  
 1  3  
-*

Now add 0 to the tree. Which one is the first node to go out of balance?


7. How do you fix this node? (Use the following rotation as an example: rightRotation(30), or leftRotation(10))

8. What are the four main steps of mergesort?

9. What are the four main steps of quicksort?

8. What is an angular directive?

9. When specifying an angular directive, you write a function which must return an object called:
a. Directive Constructor
b. Fidel y Chavez Object
c. Directive Definition object
d. Directive Object

10. What is the relationship between html, the $scope construct, and angular expressions? (Expressions are the ones that are written like so: {{quote}} ).

11. In order to send ajax requests in Angular, you need to create an angular:
a. Module  
b. Service
c. Controller
d. $http

12. In order to create a service, you must use the following angular function:
a. angularApp.controller
b. angularApp.module
c. angularApp.directive
d. angularApp.factory

13. Go to my [angular projects github repo](https://github.com/Swolebrain/ng-starter-projects) and do one of them. Don't clone the repository, but rather add all the files to the folder which corresponds to your github repo. Add the files right at the root of your repo, not within a subfolder.
