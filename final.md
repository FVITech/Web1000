#Final exam

1. What are the four steps of mergesort?

2. Using JavaScript, generate a random number between 50 and 100.

3. Using Javascript, generate a random number between -100 and 100.

4. Write a coin flip function. It should return the string "heads" half the time and the string "tails" the other half
  function coinFlip(){

  }

5. Re-state the following expression without using negation:
  !(10 > x)

6. Re-state the following expression without using negation:
  !(a > 10 && b <= 5)

7. Re-state the following expression without using negation:

8. What is an Angular directive?

9. Write a function which, given a 2-d array of strings, returns the concatenation of all the strings.

12. Given the following edge list, draw the graph.

```javascript
E = [[1,2], [2,3], [4,5], [2,4], [1,5]  ]
```

13. Given the following adjacency Matrix, determine whether the graph is directed or undirected and draw it.

```javascript
M = [
  [0,0,1,0,1],
  [0,0,0,0,1],
  [0,1,0,0,0],
  [0,1,0,0,0],
  [0,0,0,0,1],
]
```

14. For exercises 9 and 10, if you assume that n is the size of one side of the matrix, what is the time complexity (Big Oh) of the algorithms you wrote?
