# Quiz 1

1. An angular directive is:
  1. The same thing as a Controller
  2. A way to define a custom element or attribute.
  3. A way to use ng-app
  4. A way for angular to communicate with a specific API

2. Write the JavaScript code necessary to create a controller named "PageController" which prints the string "hello world" as soon as the page loads and the controller runs.

3. Given the following angular module declaration:

  ```JavaScript
  var app = angular.module("CookiesApp", ['ngRoute', 'ngAnimate']);
  ```
  How do you bind this angular module to a particular portion of your html page (for instance the body tag)?

4. Write a **recursive** function which receives an array and returns the sum of the elements of the array.


5.	Given two temperatures, return true if one is less than 0 and the other is greater than 100.  
  a.	icyHot(120, -1) → true  
  b.	icyHot(-1, 120) → true  
  c.	icyHot(2, 120) → false  

6.	Given 2 ints, a and b, return true if one if them is 10 or if their sum is 10.  
  a.	makes10(9, 10) → true  
  b.	makes10(9, 9) → false  
  c.	makes10(1, 9) → true  

7.	Given a string, take the first 2 chars and return the string with the 2 chars added at both the front and back, so "kitten" yields"kikittenki". If the string length is less than 2, use whatever chars are there.  
  a.	front22("kitten") → "kikittenki"  
  b.	front22("Ha") → "HaHaHa"  
  c.	front22("abc") → "ababcab"
