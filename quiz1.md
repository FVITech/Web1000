3. Given the following angular module declaration:

  ```JavaScript
  var app = angular.module("CookiesApp", ['ngRoute', 'ngAnimate']);

  How do you bind this angular module to a particular portion of your html page (for instance the body tag)?

4. Run Euclid’s GCD algorithm for the following pairs of numbers. Show work.
  1.	10, 99
  2.	12, 128
  3.	65536, 1024
  4.	24, 40
  5.	58, 57
  6.	32, 48
  7.	44, 121



5.	Given two temperatures, return true if one is less than 0 and the other is greater than 100.  
  a.	icyHot(120, -1) → true  
  b.	icyHot(-1, 120) → true  
  c.	icyHot(2, 120) → false  

6.	Given 2 ints, a and b, return true if one if them is 10 or if their sum is 10.  
  a.	makes10(9, 10) → true  
  b.	makes10(9, 9) → false  
  c.	makes10(1, 9) → true  

7.	Given a string, take the first 2 chars and return the string with the 2 chars added at both the front and back, so "kitten" yields"kikittenki". If the string length is less than 2, use whatever chars are there.  
  a.	front22("kitten") → "kikittenki"  
  b.	front22("Ha") → "HaHaHa"  
  c.	front22("abc") → "ababcab"
