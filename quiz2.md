#Angular, Data Structures, and search algos exam

Instructions: create a new repository called ng-ds-test. Within this repo, create a README.md file. Copy and paste all of these questions into this README file and answer them.

1. Name and describe the two main operations of a stack (to add and remove data).


2. Name and describe the two main operations of a queue (to add and remove data).

3. Draw the tree resulting from adding the following sequence of numbers to an empty tree: 30, 45, 15, 10, 50, 40, 20, 27


4. Is this tree balanced? If not, which rotation needs to be done? (Use the following rotation as an example: rightRotation(30), or leftRotation(10))


5. Now add 29. Is the tree balanced? If not, which rotation needs to be done? (Use the following rotation as an example: rightRotation(30), or leftRotation(10))

6. Consider the following tree:    
  ------5  
  ---2-----8  
  -1--3  

  Now add 0 to the tree. Which one is the first node to go out of balance?

7. How do you fix this node? (Use the following rotation as an example: rightRotation(30), or leftRotation(10))

8. What are the four main steps of mergesort?

9. Say you have a program which handles the login queue to a game server. The game server is able to log in one person every one second. Assume that one second must elapse after a person logs in with an empty queue before they are removed from the queue. Draw the state of the queue at 12:00:06, considering the following sequence of events:
    1. At 12:00:00 Hades logs in
    2. At 12:00:00 Ares logs in
    3. At 12:00:00 Zeus logs in
    4. At 12:00:00 Buzz Light Year logs in
    5. At 12:00:02 Kanye West logs in
    6. At 12:00:03 Taylor Swift logs in
    7. At 12:00:03 Darkwing Duck logs in
    8. At 12:00:04 Evil Mickey logs in.

10. What is an angular directive?

11. When specifying an angular directive, you write a function which must return an object called:  
  a. Directive Constructor  
  b. Fidel y Chavez Object  
  c. Directive Definition object  
  d. Directive Object  

12. What is the relationship between html, the $scope construct, and angular expressions? (Expressions are the ones that are written like so: {{quote}} ).

13. In order to send ajax requests in Angular, the most accepted programming convention is to create an angular:  
  a. Module    
  b. Service  
  c. Controller  
  d. $http  

14. In order to create a service, you must use the following angular function:  
  a. angularApp.controller  
  b. angularApp.module  
  c. angularApp.directive  
  d. angularApp.factory  

15. Do this exercise: https://github.com/Real-Skill/angular-exercises/tree/exercise1
You will need to run git checkout exercise1 in addition to the commands listed in that readme. You do not need to run grunt karma.
