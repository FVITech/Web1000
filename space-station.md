#Space Station project

The Open Notify API provides provides information about who's in space right now. Visit
http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json to see not only how many people are currently in space but also their names and which spacecraft theyâ€™re on.  

Create a program that pulls in this data and displays the information from this API in a tabular format. For minimum credit, you need to display it in a nicely formatted table.

For full credit, you will need to create a canvas app that displays the Earth, and for each spacecraft create a rotating satellite around it with the names of the astronauts it has, as a text label. You can use [this app](http://jsfiddle.net/wY8d7/1/) as a sample. Make sure you color the earth and the satellites adequately.
