#Sudoku Project

For this project, you will need to complete a Sudoku game. You are strongly encouraged to do it with Angular, but jQuery or plain JS are fine too.

[Here](https://youtu.be/1YA_mQFWDKY) is a sample working solution submitted by a student.

Your project must:

1. Correctly generate a starting board: You may use the [fvi endpoint](http://fvi-grad.com:4004/sudoku)
2. Allow user to input numbers in each cell
3. Have a button that when clicked validates the submission. You may implement the validation yourself, or send a post request to http://fvi-grad.com:4004/sudoku
4. Upon validation, the user is notified of whether or not the solution was correct.
5. Your project should look decent. Don't turn something in that looks like a baboon's butt cheeks.
